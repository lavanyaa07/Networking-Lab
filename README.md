CA Assignment
You are hired as a network engineer for Bit Network Solutions, a mid-sized enterprise with a nine-floor office building.
Each floor is equipped with 5 computers, and the organization requires a well-structured network to ensure efficient communication and scalability.
Network Design Requirements:
1. Topology Selection: Design a ring topology for first two floors, mesh topology for next two floors, and star topology for remaining floors, considering performance and fault tolerance.
2. IP Addressing Scheme: The company has decided to use Class B private IPv4 addresses for first three floors and then Class C public IPv4 addresses for remaining floors following a classful addressing scheme. Allocate IP addresses properly for each floor, ensuring uniqueness.
3. Routing Strategy for Inter-Floor Communication & Connectivity: Recommend a routing approach that is dynamic for inter-floor communication.
• Design how the floors will be connected for seamless inter-department communication.
• Suggest the appropriate network devices (e.g., switches, routers, access points) and their placement.
• If using dynamic routing, suggest an appropriate routing protocol (e.g., RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP) with justification.
• If using static routing, define the static routes for efficient data flow.
• Specify the number of default gateways along with IP addresses.
